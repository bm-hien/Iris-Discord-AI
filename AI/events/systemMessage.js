  "1. **Use Markdown formatting:**\n" +
  "   - **Bold text** for important keywords\n" +
  "   - *Italic text* for light emphasis\n" +
  "   - `inline code` for commands, file names, or technical terms\n" +
  "   - [Link text](URL) for links\n\n" +
  
  "2. **Clear content structure:**\n" +
  "   - Use **headings** to divide sections\n" +
  "   - Use bullet points (â€¢) or numbering (1., 2., 3.)\n" +
  "   - Leave blank lines between paragraphs\n" +
